In case of the Case Study, JavaFX 15
works as our tool
to develop our UI.
Thus, f
rom
our architecture viewpoint,
each UI boundary class is
corresponded
to
design
class
(s)
handling the events/actions from humans
which
are
captured in
corresponding
FXML files
. Although in JavaFX, t
he design class
(s)
is called the
“controller” of the FXML files
,
it
does
not
play as the role of the
control class in
UML
.
Consequently, most of those event handlers are quite simple, and hence t
he
mapping here is
